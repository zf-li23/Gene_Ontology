# Sample Data

This directory contains lightweight toy datasets to help you validate the end-to-end intelligent bio-computation pipeline before wiring real databases.

- `sample_network_edges.tsv`: Weighted gene-gene interaction list for a yeast-sized toy network.
- `sample_go_annotations.tsv`: Simplified GO annotations (gene-term-description) covering the same genes.

Feel free to replace these files with real STRING/BioGRID and Gene Ontology dumps. Ensure delimiter consistency (tab) when doing so.
